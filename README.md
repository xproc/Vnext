# XProc Vnext

This repository simply serves as an assembly point for all issues for a next version of XProc. It doesn't differentiate between issues for steps, the core specification or any other area. If known, the issues are labelled what area/sub-specification they're for. 

So if you have any wild idea that needs to be discussed if/when we ever get around to specifying a new version, add it here.
